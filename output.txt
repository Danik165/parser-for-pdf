BACKGROUND:   
As the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) continues to make significant progress towards the 
successful implementation and compliance of its Federal Records program as it relates to 
electronic records management, digitization, and digitalization transformation of the agency 
Service-wide. IRS Records and Information Management (RIM) is currently postured to 
continue enhancing IRS’ records management approach pursuant to federal laws, National 
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) guidance and Bulletins for federal agencies to 
include the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)/NARA M-19-21- Transition to 
Electronic Records Directive, IRS internal revenue manual (IRM) policies for Records 
Management, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Privacy and Disclosure, and other 
related external regulations (e.g., NIST 800-53, SI-12).  The M-19-21 Directive states that 
“Federal agencies should electronically manage all temporary and permanent email by 
December 31, 2016, and all permanent electronic records by December 31, 2019,” along with 
other related deadlines.  NARA recently announced that the M-19-21 deadlines will be 
modified with new extended dates (pending release).  The vendor will be required to 
demonstrate ability to be flexible and work in an agile environment. 
IRS formulated an enterprise Records Management strategic approach that will enable us to 
deliver a robust and efficient program in this discipline that complies with existing statutes and 
directives that positions the agency for future demands. One important aspect of the enterprise 
plan is an effort to align IRS's technology to support an environment of enterprise content 
management and digitization efforts. Currently, infrastructure updates include our document 
collaboration platform. 


The relationship between records management, knowledge management, transparency, and 
accountability cannot be overlooked. Records identification, retention, and search ability will 
enable the IRS to identify and compile risk, risk considerations and decisions made, and 
development and implement risk mitigation strategies. 
IRS’s primary goal is to bring the IRS into full compliance with agency goals and policies, 
external requirements, and enhanced electronic records management processes into new state of 
the art solutions that are supported by best industry practices.
